# Computing Assignment Team Project

We were tasked with creating a Sokoban clone in Java, using Object Oriented Programming as well as utilising an Agile work process. We created a map generator, which was built from a Sokoban solver, as well as extra funky features in levels 11 and 12.

The general aim of the Sokoban game is to push the boxes to their goal squares in as little moves as possible

## Level 11 Preview
Level 11 in theme 2. The red projectiles are shot out of the red boxes that follow the players movements. The projectiles are fired once every 2 seconds and move rather quickly.

Level 12 in theme 1. The purple projectiles are like the red projectiles but even faster and are shot at an angle to make it even more difficult for the player.
